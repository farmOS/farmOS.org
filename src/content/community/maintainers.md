### Michael Stenta

Michael Stenta is the founder, maintainer, and lead developer of
[farmOS](https://github.com/farmOS/farmOS).

He developed the vision for farmOS while working simultaneously as a farm
apprentice and a web developer, and has since lead the farmOS code and community
development efforts in an open and transparent way. Michael works closely with
farmers, organizations, and universities to develop new features, and helps
host farmOS instances via [Farmier](https://farmier.com/). His process is rooted
in direct experience working on and with farms around the United States, both in
the soil and in computer code.
