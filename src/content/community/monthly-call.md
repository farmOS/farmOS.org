# Monthly Call

The farmOS community hosts a monthly call via [Jitsi]. Anyone is welcome to join.
Ask questions, brainstorm ideas, or just talk farming.

An agenda will often be created in advance of each monthly call. The upcoming
agenda and archive of call notes can be found [on the forum](https://farmos.discourse.group/tag/community-call).

Refer to the schedule below, and use the "Join Call" link to join the call.

**NOTE:** In case you have problems joining a call, check the #farmOS [chat room].
Last minute updates or changes will be communicated there!

## [Join Call]

Calls are currently held on the second Wednesday of the month, at 2pm Eastern
US time.

Note that Daylight Savings Time is observed in the US, so the time relative to
UTC (Universal Time Coordinated) will change twice a year. The schedule below
shows that, along with the actual UTC times for each call. UTC is for most
purposes the same as GMT.
