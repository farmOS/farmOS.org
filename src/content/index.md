**farmOS is a web-based application for farm management, planning, and record
keeping. It is developed by a community of farmers, developers, researchers, and
organizations with the aim of providing a standard platform for agricultural
data collection and management.**

The farmOS server is built on top of [Drupal], which makes it [modular],
[extensible], and [secure]. The [farmOS Field Kit] app provides offline data
entry in a native Android/iOS app, and as a progressive web app (PWA) at
[https://farmOS.app].

Both are licensed under the [GNU General Public License], which means they are
[free] and [open source].

To learn how to use farmOS, refer to the [User Guide]. For more information,
visit the [farmOS Community Forum] and read the [Frequently Asked Questions].

You can contribute to the project by [making a donation] or [contributing] in
other ways.
