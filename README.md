# farmOS.org
This is the repository for the official farmOS website, https://farmos.org.

It was built using [Gatsby.js], based on the [`gatsby-starter-default`]. Technical
documentation for farmOS, its client applications and libraries are loaded from
separate repositories via [`gatsby-source-git`], listed in [`source-repos.js`].

Development was supported by the [farmOS Community on Open Collective]. For more
background on the project, see the ["farmOS.org Redesign"] topic on the farmOS forum.
